# Quantum Annealing for solving QUBO Problems

Python implementation of research: Pastorello, D. and Blanzieri, E., 2019. Quantum annealing learning search for solving QUBO problems. Quantum Information Processing, 18(10), p.303.

To start the program run *start.py* script and follow instructions on terminal.

In order to change hyperparameters open file *start.py* and change them in line 154, future updates will provide *csv* file hyperparameters.

If you want to add QAP problems just add them in qap folder.
